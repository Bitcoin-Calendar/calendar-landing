This page outlines the development roadmap for the Bitcoin Calendar project, organized by quarter with specific goals and milestones.

The goal of the Bitcoin Calendar project is to become a FOSS, self sovereign app with minimal to no dependency on third-party services. This will include storing historical events details, hosting an archive of all the webpages and a media server for all related media files, running Nostr relay to broadcast events, launching a website to display events and allow visitors to interact with them and spinning up a historian chatbot that will be able to communicate with Nostr users in plane English. We are at the very beginning of the journey:
