Bitcoin Calendar is an [open source](https://github.com/Bitcoin-Calendar) project consisting of multiple mini apps, that ensure that hundreds of Bitcoin historical events, related media and reference web pages are properly stored and archived and the events themselves are regularly posted to Nostr and displayed on a dedicated website. Bitcoin Calendar ensures that key moments are never forgotten.
